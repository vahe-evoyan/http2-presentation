# SPDY

## 2009

#### Compression <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
#### Multiplexing <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
#### Prioritization <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
#### ... <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

## Wait! <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->


Note:

OK. Enough about workarounds and bad performance. I believe many of you know
what the SPDY is. It was founded by Google on 2009 to decrease the page load
time. The goal was to keep the HTTP semantics, so the webpage developers
wouldn't need to change their content, and redice the page load time by 50%.

SPDY introduces a really cool technology including *compression*,
*multiplexing*, *prioritization*, ...

But wait! We will talk about all of this a bit later, in the scope of HTTP/2.
Yes, HTTP/2 is based on SPDY 4.0 with minor changes. There are some important
point to mention for SPDY though.
